## How to run locally

You will need to fire up a local web server to run locally. The easiest way is using python, run the following command in the working directory:
(assuming Python 3)
```sh
python -m http.server
```

The only reason it needs a local web server is because it attempts to load the `judge_thread.js` file as a Web Worker. You can uncomment the line that simulates no worker support to disable this (you'll find it at the top of `example.js`), which will allow you to just open `index.html` in a browser to run it.
